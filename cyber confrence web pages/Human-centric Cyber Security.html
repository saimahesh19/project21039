<p style="font-size:70px">Human-centric Cybersecurity: How to make ‘People Matter’
</p>
<h1> Summary</h1>
<img src="helpnet-banner-portrait-3.jpg" align="right" width="700" height="600" >
<h3>
Increasingly, cybercriminals are turning to the ‘human factor’ to execute a cyber-attack. Therefore, cybersecurity is much more than a technology problem. Attacks focus on finding ways to exploit human behavior to then begin a chain of events that results in stolen credentials and other data, ransomware infection, DDoS attacks, and general IT chaos.
<br>
The human being in the attack chain is seen as an easy, low-hanging no-hack option, to infiltrate a network and carry out a destructive and often financially lucrative cyber-attack.
<br>
In 2021, every 11 seconds a company became a victim of a ransomware attack.<br>
88% of security breaches have human error at their core, according to research from Stanford University.<br>
Research shows that 96% of data breaches start with a phishing email.<br>
Human factors play a major part in cybersecurity risk; a study found that “careless or uninformed staff” are the second most likely cause of a security breach<br>
This report looks at how a people-first approach to cybersecurity can turn your employees into the ultimate cybersecurity warrior.<br></h3>

Part One: Understanding the Human Factor in The Cybersecurity Threat Landscape</h1><br>
<h3>
<h2>
“We must influence the behaviors of people who see Information Security as something technical, and not something they can influence themselves.” - Professor Phil Morgan<br>
</h2>
<h3>
Cybercriminals use human behavior as a pawn in their game. Phishing is a perfect example of how behavior is exploited to carry out a cyber-attack. Phishing relies on a human to click a malicious link or download an infected attachment to switch the big red attack button to on.  Human psychology, cognitive factors, and applied social cognition must become part of the security professional lexicon. In ensuring cyber-security, the industry must take on a ‘human-centric’ or socio-technical cyber-security approach. The key component of this approach is us, the human.
<br>
To achieve this human-centric approach, organizations need to embrace a sub-discipline of psychology known as ‘Human factors’. This emergent area links human behavior to engineering and elements of computer science to develop a holistic approach to cyber-risk management.
<br>
<h1>
Cyberpsychology and ‘Human Factors’ </h1><br>
<h2>
Human Factors</h2>
<h3>
Research into the impact of human Factors on the use of tools, methods, and theories, merge psychology, engineering, and other traditional disciplines to better understand human interaction with systems. 
<br>
The aim is to improve the symbiosis between people and the technology that they use. In doing so, this optimizes that interaction, and therefore, reduces the number of human errors that lead to cyber-attack success.
<br>
“10 years of research has shown me that we will never get close to developing effective solutions in cyber-security without disciplines like psychology and its sub-disciplines like human factors research. A socio-technical approach is crucial. A technical only approach can achieve quite a lot but will not result in seamless cyber-security where humans are part of the systems.“
<br><h2>
In conversation with Professor Phil Morgan:

"Human factor research aims to change the behavior of people. This means that the human operator must understand their role in influencing technologies. A human-centric approach to cybersecurity is one of education, understanding, and changes the dial from a purely technical fix to one that more addresses that type of threats that modern cyber-attacks use."
<br></h2>
<h1>
Cyberpsychology<br></h1> 
<h3>
Cyberpsychology is a merger of cyber-security and humans. The basis of the discipline is to develop human-oriented systems for a given type of technological area.  Cyberpsychology applies to home, work and Work from Anywhere environments.
<br>
The challenge is to ensure that anyone who interacts with the digital realm understands how cybersecurity works.  The problem stems from the ‘plug-and-play’ view of technology, instilled in human behavior as digital technology has evolved over the decades. Cybersecurity beha++++++vior is then seen as a ‘blocker’, something that adds an extra burden on the human user.</h3>
