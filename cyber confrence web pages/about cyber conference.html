  <h2 align="CENTER">OCTOBER 18-22 </h2> 
<p style="font-size:40px"> ABOUT INFOSEC WORLD</p>
<h3><i>
InfoSec World is the leading cybersecurity conference for security practitioners and executives. 
Now in its 28th year, InfoSec World has been known as the “Business of Security” conference—featuring
 expert insights, enlightening keynotes, and interactive breakout sessions that inform, engage,
 and connect the infosec community. This event provides participants with essential tools and 
solutions to better prevent, detect and respond to today’s security challenges.</i></h3>

<p style="font-size:26px"> 
The vision of ASSURED is to design and implement a novel policy-driven, formally verified, runtime 
assurance framework in the complex domain of Cyber-Physical System (CPS).
</p>
<p style="font-size:40px"> 
HIGHLY-USABLE, RESILIENT CYBERSECURITY, PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK</p>
<p style="font-size:26px"> 
The design and development of a novel, highly-usable, and resilient cybersecurity, privacy and data 
protection management framework, targeted at “Systems-of-Systems” (SoS) enabled ecosystems, aiming
 at: (i) providing strong system integrity and operational assurance of safety-critical components towards 
the enabling of the integration of heterogeneous Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) to a SoS with federated trust, 
and (ii) accountable sharing of complex data flows, through the use of Blockchain distributed ledgers & smart 
contracts, encountered in today’s hyper-connected digital supply networks.
</p>
<p style="font-size:40px"> 
HIGHLY AUTOMATED MIDDLEWARE FOR THE SECURE CONFIGURATION, MANAGEMENT OF EDGE DEVICES, 
PROCESSES AND SAFETY-CRITICAL SOFTWARE COMPONENTS.</p>
<p style="font-size:26px"> 
The construction of a highly automated middleware for the secure configuration, deployment, operation,
 management and maintenance of edge devices, processes and safety-critical software components. This
 will be based on the development of novel, remote and scalable attestation and verification programmable
 components as a means of assurance and trusted interoperability between a wide range of Systems-of-Systems,
 targeting all layers of the software stack, including design verification and testing to runtime attestation and
 enforcement. The aim of this process is to enable the support of extended “trusted chains of devices” with strong 
claims on their correctness and functional safety, from their trusted launch and configuration to the verification 
of both behavioural and low-level concrete execution properties about an entity’s integrity and execution correctness.

<p style="font-size:40px"> 
REACTIVE, RUNTIME RISK ASSESSMENT MODEL</p>
<p style="font-size:26px"> 
The identification and implementation of a reactive, runtime risk assessment model, facilitating the real-time handling 
of threats and identified risks, for enhancing the security- and privacy-by-design features of the entire ASSURED security
 assurance and data sharing framework through a holistic threat assessment against aspects of such hyper-connected 
SoS. This will enable the dynamic assessment and forecast of individual, cumulative and propagated risks, taking into 
account the representation of assets along with their dependencies, the associated threats and vulnerabilities and the 
potential cascading effects, thus, allowing for enhanced situation awareness adaptation of the entire SoS-enabled ecosystem
 (based on newly identified vulnerabilities and the prediction of unseen cyber threats) supporting policy adjustments and
 the compilation of updated mitigation strategies and attestation policies.
</p>
<p style="font-size:40px"> 
SAFE IMPLEMENTATION OF MIXED-CRITICALITY APPLICATIONS IN CPSS</p>
<IMG SRC="aucc2.png" width="500" height="500" align="right">
<p style="font-size:26px"> 
The leverage of the ASSURED Framework to automatically infer optimal software deployment plans, for the safe implementation
 of mixed-criticality applications in CPSs, and support their correct execution and verification through an incremental adoption 
and deployment of (on-demand) capability-oriented security attestation controls. The deployment of these security elements is
 going to be produced (and updated when needed) based on the live announcement of vulnerabilities through the interaction with
 the ASSURED risk assessment toolkit and other open threat intelligence services (i.e., CVVE). Thus, the objective is to significantly
 reduce the complexity and scalability issues with such strong control-flow integrity verification solutions and to facilitate the 
immediate reaction to newly identified threats.</p>
<p style="font-size:40px"> 
SECURE, TRUSTED AND AUDIBLE DATA SHARING ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p style="font-size:26px"> 
The provision of a secure, trusted and audible data sharing environment (for threat intelligence data and beyond) by designing 
and implementing advanced Blockchain operation and control services through leveraging distributed ledgers infrastructure 
and specifying novel Trusted Component (TC)-enabled security and privacy-preserving protocols for advancing the state-of-the-art
 in scalability and computational efficiency when providing fully transparent and accountable secure information exchange 
(through the use of smart contracts) based on traceable and credible security auditing and attestation activities.
</p>
<p style="font-size:40px"> 
IMPLEMENTATION & EVALUATION OF THE ASSURED MODELS AND MECHANISMS IN THE FOUR ENVISIONED USE CASES</p>
<p style="font-size:26px"> 
The delivery of the applicability, usability, effectiveness and value of the ASSURED concepts, models and identified security, 
privacy, trust and operational assurance enablers in real-world industries, safety critical infrastructures and applications
 (under pragmatic conditions), against a pre-defined set of demonstrators, along with the development of threat intelligence 
data and data sharing to reap the benefits of interconnected SoS and supply chains that are affected by the absent of secure 
digital supply networks with strong security auditing mechanisms.
