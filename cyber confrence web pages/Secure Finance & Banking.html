<H1><MARQUEE>2022 INTERNATIONAL  CONFERENCE ON CYBER SECURITY</MARQUEE> </H1>

<p style="font-size:70px">Cyber Security for Banking & Finance Industry
</p>

<h1>Background :</h1>
<h3>
Every customer and client's personally identifiable information is given to financial services 
providers such as banks, credit unions, credit card companies, and investment businesses. 
Home address, Social Security number, banking information, phone number, email address, 
and income information are all included. Because of the great value of this data on the darknet, 
fraudsters are attracted to this area.
</h3>
<h1>Key Challanges:</h1>
<h3>
<ul>
<li>Cybercriminals are aggressively targeting the sector, and the current surge in Covid-19-related 
phishing assaults is escalating the situation.</li>
<li> Theft, corruption, or breach of a bank's network 
and customer or proprietary data must be prevented.</li>
<li>Financial services companies create enormous volumes of data, which is frequently fragmented 
and misused.</li>
<li>The growing threat of data access via mobile applications: as more people use banking accounts
 through mobile apps, which aren't always secure, banks should take steps to avoid identity theft 
and other criminal acts.</li>
<li>Breach through third-party institutions: Once financial data is exchanged on third-party networks,
 hackers pay more attention to it since it is less safeguarded.</li>
<li>Because it's yet unclear in this industry how to deploy cybersecurity software fully, the pace of 
attacks in the ever-changing cryptocurrency business is increasing.</li>
